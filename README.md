# XDBot2OptionTriggers
A simple script that converts an XDBot macro to Geometry Dash Option Triggers

# how to use?

1. Install the GD Savefile Editor by WEGFan - https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Editor
2. Decrypt your CCLocalLevels.dat. Make sure to prettify the XML for easier modifications!
3. Go into CCLocalLevels.dat.xml and find the level string. This should be 2 lines below the level name. Then copy the level string.
4. Go to https://cyberchef.org/ and create a recipe, the recipe should be:
                             From Base64 (URL Safe)
                             Gunzip
Then paste the zipped and base64 encoded level string into the input section.
5. Copy the gunzipped level string. Create a new file called level.txt in the same folder as the script. Paste the fully decoded level string into this file.
6. Run through the script. This will modify levels.txt and add option triggers to it.
7. Copy the new level string generated by the script
8. Paste the new level string back into your CCLocalLevels.dat.xml.
9. Re-encrypt the level string using the GD Savefile Editor
10. Drag the re-encrypted CCLocalsLevels.dat back into your GeometryDash folder.

In the future, I may try to make this more user friendly, possibly automatically decrypting and encrypting your save file and automatically retrieving your top level.
